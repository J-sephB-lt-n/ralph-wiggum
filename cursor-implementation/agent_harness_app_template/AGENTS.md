# General Principles

- You must always write code that (where relevant) fulfils all of the requirements of high quality code:
  - **Functionality (correctness)** : Works as expected and fulfills its intended purpose.
  - **Readability**: Is easy for humans to quickly comprehend (code is optimised for clarity).
  - **Documentation**: Clearly explains its purpose and usage.
  - **Standards Compliance**: Adheres to conventions and guidelines (e.g. PEP 8 for python code).
  - **Reusability**: Can be used in different contexts without modification.
  - **Maintainability**: Allows for modifications and extensions without introducing bugs.
  - **Robustness**: Handles errors and unexpected inputs effectively.
  - **Testability**: Can be easily verified for correctness.
  - **Efficiency**: Optimizes time and resource usage.
  - **Scalability**: Handles increased data loads or complexity without degradation.
  - **Security**: Protects against vulnerabilities and malicious inputs.
- Aim for high cohesion within modules and low coupling between them.
- Unless you are only providing a single argument and it is obvious what that argument is, always use named arguments when calling a function.
- Use assert statements frequently as lightweight validation of the expected state of the system.
  - Always include a short assert message.
- Aim for high cohesion within modules and low coupling between them.
- Very long `.py` scripts are a code smell. Over 500 lines is a warning, but generally still ok if there is a good reason. Python scripts over 1000 lines require a strong justification. Obviously, one expects HTML, template files, data files like CSV etc. to be very long.
- Code should not be platform-specific e.g. filepaths should use `Path(...)` from `pathlib` not windows path strings.
- Python imports should always appear at the top of the _.py_ script (e.g. not within functions etc.), unless there is a strong justification for it.
- NEVER use relative pathing logic like `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent` - this indicates a project organisation failure. All python scripts should be executed from the same project directory.
- If you encounter any inconsistencies or contradicting information in your task requirements, always bring this to my attention.

# Type Annotation

- Type annotate everything.
- Make the type annotations as readable as possible (prioritise readability over comprehensiveness).
- Don't use typing.Dict, typing.List, typing.Tuple etc. (you can use the base types dict, list, tuple etc. in type annotations on python 3.9+).
- After working on a piece of code, use `uv run ty check` to check that your type annotations are correct (you may need to install `ty` using `uv add --dev ty`)
- Never use `from __future__ import annotations` - just quote forward references directly (`foo: "Bar"`) or use `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING`
- Use `typing.NewType` rather than base types so that complex type annotations become self-documenting e.g. `dict[UserId, UserMetadata]` rather than `dict[str, dict]`

# Documentation

- All codebases should have a README.md file at the project root. It must be a brief but information dense document (optimised for human-readability) containing important context for understanding the application, intended to provide new developers with sufficient information to begin contributing to the codebase. It should include:
  - The name of the application
  - A high-level description of the primary goal(s) of the application
  - Instructions on how to setup and run the application (and test suite).
  - An explanation of the layout of the codebase
  - All modules, classes and functions must have google-style docstrings.
- Comments should be used sparingly. As far as possible, code should be self-documenting. Here are some general principles which often help:
  - Descriptive naming.
  - Complex logic broken down into well-named single-responsibility chunks (clean abstractions).
  - No magic numbers (use named constants instead).
- In any other places where documentation is optional (e.g the "description" argument in `pydantic.Field` on attributes in a `pydantic.BaseModel`, the "help" argument in `argparse.ArgumentParser().add_argument()`, always provide useful documentation).

# Software Testing

- I don't believe in 100% test coverage, but please identify parts of the code which would be made more robust by adding tests and raise these with me.
- The test suite is going to consist of hundreds of tests, so ensure that no individual unit test takes more than 1 second to run.
- You are never allowed to delete or modify existing tests. If you have a compelling reason to do so, ask me directly for permission first.

# Error Handling

- Exceptions are an important signal and should not be thoughtlessly suppressed.
- Unexpected program behaviour must raise an exception (don't try to catch developer mistakes with error-handling code).
- A bare try/except may only be used at the topmost end-user-facing level of the application (if at all). All other exceptions must bubble up.
- Always log the full stack trace (e.g. use _logger.exception()_ rather than _logger.error()_)

# User Inputs

- User inputs should always be assumed to be malicious.

# Red Flags

- ALWAYS ask permission before using any of the following functions/keywords:
  - exec
  - eval
  - global

# Environment Variables

- Never print or log secrets
- Always use `override=True` in `dotenv.load_dotenv()`, to avoid using existing global secrets by accident.
