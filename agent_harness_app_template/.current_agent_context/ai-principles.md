They are bad at niche tasks. i.e. use the most common technologies and standards (json, bash, git, react etc.)<br>- LLMs inherit bad habits (e.g. python bare try/except). Can mitigate with prompting (e.g. AGENTS.md)<br>- Magic words like "vertical slice architecture" or "Test-Driven Development" or "John Ousterhout" convey a lot of context to a LLM (drastically change their behaviour)<br>- Provide in-house style guides and conventions (architecture too)<br>- Prefer agents for generalist tasks |
